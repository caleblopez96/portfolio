      <p>Full-time student currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Graphic Information Technology with a focus in full-stack web development from Arizona State University.

Capable of handling front-end and back-end tasks, I am eagerly seeking full-stack internship opportunities for the summer of 2025 to showcase my knowledge and learn from industry professionals. My dream is to turn this passion in to a career.</p>
